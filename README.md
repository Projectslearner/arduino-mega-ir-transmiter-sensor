# IR Transmitter Sensor

#### Project Overview

The IR Transmitter Sensor project demonstrates how to use an IR LED with an Arduino Mega to send infrared signals. This project sends a specific IR code at regular intervals and prints the sent code to the Serial Monitor for debugging purposes.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **IR LED**
- **Resistor (220 ohms)**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the IR LED to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Anode** (longer leg) of the IR LED to digital pin 3 (`irLedPin`) on Arduino Mega through a 220-ohm resistor.
   - **Cathode** (shorter leg) of the IR LED to **GND** on Arduino Mega.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the IR LED to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Library Installation:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Go to `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries`.
   - Search for `IRremote` and install the library by `shirriff`.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

4. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for messages indicating the sent IR code.
   - The IR LED will blink briefly when the code is sent.

#### Applications

- **Remote Control Systems:** Use in projects requiring the transmission of remote control signals.
- **Home Automation:** Integrate into home automation systems to control devices using IR signals.
- **Learning Projects:** Great for learning how IR communication works and how to transmit IR signals in microcontroller projects.

#### Notes

- Replace the `irCode` variable in the `sendIRSignal` function with the actual IR code for your device. You can find these codes using an IR receiver and observing the codes from your remote.
- Adjust the delay in the `loop` function to control how often the IR signal is sent.
- Ensure the IR LED is positioned correctly to transmit signals effectively to the target device.
